# Standard-Map

This notebook generates a standard map, also known as the Chirikov standard map (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_map). This Python code was developed during the Computational Astrodynamics course, specifically 
in the Hamiltonian systems section, as part of the master's program in Computational Physics at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

You will also find some .png files of standard maps that were generated using this notebook.
